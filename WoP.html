<h3>Introduction&nbsp;</h3>
Wizard of props is a project that is led by <a href="http://www.albertosarus233.com/">Ruixiang Albert Han</a> and <a href="http://amyuzhenzhang.github.io">Adam Yuzheng Zhang</a> and supervised by <a href="http://wendyju.com">Wendy Ju</a> and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/daniel-leithinger">Daniel Leithinger</a>. This project introduces the VRWizard system that integrates substitutions reality, haptic feedback in VR, and Wizard of Oz design. VRWizard integrates full-scale physical props with VR visualization to support the interactive design process, which allows interactive designers (e.g. architects,&nbsp; stage designers, and tangible device designers) to design in such a hybrid environment. Our contribution to the community is twofold: 1) proposing a construction kit for props in substitutional reality and 2) revealing some crucial aspects of interaction design that are usually ignored in the current workflow.

<h3>Technical description&nbsp;</h3>
<em><code>Physical props.</code> </em><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">The physical prop (Figure 2.A) of the WoP system is made up of a cardboard frame and two </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">cardboard door panels on casters, allowing the panels to slide with one degree of freedom (DoF), forming a bilateral </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">opening door.</span>

<code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Virtual environment.</span></code> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">We developed a virtual scene with Unity 3D and displayed it to the participant through</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> a head-mounted VR display (HMD) (Figure 2.C and 2.D). The virtual scene consists of a subway station with </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">a boarding train.</span>

<code>Fiducial marker.</code> Two Aruco markers are attached to door dashes and traced by an external camera. Movement of the physical props triggered by participants will be therefore mapped to the digital scene, in this case, the subway carriage's door.&nbsp;

<span dir="ltr" role="presentation"><code>The hybrid synchronization.</code> In the VR application with hand-tracking enabled, the researcher would first point at the central origin of the door with the right index finger and then move along with the orientation of the door.&nbsp;The virtual scene would reorient itself to match the transform of the physical prop.</span>

<h3>User Study</h3>
<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">We conducted a formative pilot study to explore the performance of the Wizard of Props as a system in an actual design workflow and compare this with the more-conventional design workflow, such as traditional tabletop design, using hand sketching and the Unity program. The study took approximately 40 minutes to complete and consists of four sections:</span>

<code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Introduction:</span></code> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">We explained the design task that they were expected to complete. The design goal was to create a </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">subway door-opening scenario for an approaching passenger carrying a box. No restrictions were put in except for </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">the above topic. We encouraged participants to let their imagination run wild, regardless of any considerations of </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">practicality or implementation. The overarching idea is to design an exciting yet novel interaction.</span>

<code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Design phase:</span></code> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">We asked each team to work on the same design task with the two methods: the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">WoP and the tabletop, at a random sequence in the two consecutive design phases. Using the tabletop system (Figure </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">3.A), the participants are provided paper and pen to sketch and outline their ideas, and they also have access to </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">interactive visualization of the subway door scene in Unity, with which they can drag the door panels with a mouse </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">and "animate" their door motion. Using the WoP system (Figure 3.B), the participants would operate the door prop </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">physically and experience the immersive subway scene virtually. They would command the other researcher to operate the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">other half of the sliding door prop. In each design phase, the participants would spend eight minutes on design and four </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">minutes sharing and discussing their final design with researchers. In this study, two groups worked on the design task </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">first with tabletop and then with WoP, while the other two groups worked in the opposite order.</span>

<br role="presentation" /><code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Discussion:</span></code> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">We ended the study with a semi-structured discussion that focused on their experiences and </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">reflections on the design process rather than their proposed design product. We also asked for their critique of the two </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">design methods.</span>

<h3>Result and discussion</h3>
<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">After reviewing the video documentation</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&nbsp;and analyzing the similarities and differences between the participantâ€™s bodily and speech actions in the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">two different approaches, we compiled a set of benefits and challenges that the teams experienced while using the Wizard of </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Props system for interactive design.&nbsp;</span>

<code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Spatial awareness insights.</span></code> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">The participants demonstrated their understanding of the spatial relationship in both the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">WoP system and the baseline tabletop condition. </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&nbsp;</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">In the WoP system, we observed that the enhanced spatial awareness led to an emphasis on the asymmetrical and user-centered design </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">of the door. Besides, a</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&nbsp;better</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&nbsp;understanding of the scale also helped with decision making, as one group commented, "</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">(In the tabletop </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">condition) we decided to open the door the same amount as the width of the passenger, but in VR we saw that the actual </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">subway door is quite narrow and we almost always opened the whole door.</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">"&nbsp;</span>

<div class="textLayer"><code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Experiencing the interaction while designing.</span></code> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Being a designer only does not give a comprehensive and </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">responsive understanding of the design outcome. A WoP provides participants with the double role of an experimenter and a designer. While pertaining to the roles of designer, participants could spark new ideas that are made possible by the systems based on experimenter experience. For example, compared with barely describing the closing speed of the door, WoP enables a vivid embodied experience of the movement, which enables the designer to make subtle changes until reaching the satisfying status.</span></div>

<div><code><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Ideas that are made possible by the WoP systems.</span></code> A<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">&nbsp;handful of novel ideas were inspired by the WoP design </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">system. For instance, the construction of the physical props let a group remove a light indicator that they </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">came up with in their first tabletop design phase.&nbsp; Through acting the design out with WoP, they realized that </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">the jiggling sound made by the motion of the door was enough to convey </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">the alert signal&nbsp;</span></div>
